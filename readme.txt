No. You need first to create an account and start getting stats about the social sharing activity of your website. The sharing itself works the same either way.
Own your social data and your metrics. We help you to track and analyze metrics, because E-MAILiT is integrated with Google Analytics. That's because you must have them all in one place.

Follow the simple steps below to start receiving social data for your website:
<ul>

<li>Sign in to your E-MAILiT account. Go to your domain settings and fill in the Google Analytics field, with your unique UA id of your GA account.</li>
<li>After the domain verification and the share button creation, we log your social events automatically, since E-MAILiT track your Google Analytics UA id.</li>
<li>In your Google Analytics reports, you can find the E-MAILiT social networking/sharing trend under: Content > Events > Overview > E-MAILiT</li>

<h4>How to verify a domain?</h4>

1. Login with your E-MAILiT account
2. Add a New Website
3. When press Add Website, a meta tag code snippet will display on your screen.
For example, take a look the given below:                 
`&lt;meta name="e-mailit-site-verification" content="E-MAILiT_0123456789012345678" /&gt;`
Paste only the **E-MAILiT_digits**, to the appropriate text box field at your WordPress backend Admin panel. Press Save Changes.  
**Settings** > **E-MAILiT Share**  Plugin options / Domain Verification Publisher Key  
4. Return to your E-MAILiT account and press the **Verify Site** button.  
5. Done! You can create now your first Share Button (http://www.e-mailit.com/widget/control/new_button) for your website.

> **ATTENTION / IMPORTANT**: The E-MAILiT Domain Verification System will place automatically the meta tag code snippet to the specified url source code, which was given by you, to the Website Settings > Domain.

<h4>Do I need to edit html or javascript?</h4>

There is no need to edit any line of code. The whole installation procedure of our plugin, will take place at your WordPress admin control panel. If you want a custom solution, you should create an E-MAILiT account. In that case you must combine the E-MAILiT admin control panel options with your WordPress admin control panel options.

<h4>How do I eliminate the plugin from certain pages?</h4>

Unfortunately, there is no option in WordPress for something like this. There is no an automated solution to delete locally and in certain pages, the share button code. Also, if you choose to auto-install our plugin you can't edit the html source code of your wp pages, to delete our code in certain pages. You can do the opposite, though, if you are familiar editing html and javascript code. Try to put in your preferred pages our share button code, manually.

<h4>How do I activate / de-activate your plugin?</h4>

Please, read the guide here http://wordpress.org/plugins/e-mailit/installation

<h4>I can't remove your plugin. Are you giving us a trouble plugin?</h4>

It would be dumb and catastrophic for us, to develop a plugin which can not uninstall from the computer systems. After receiving a few support messages, on how to remove the plugin, have been revealed that the default un-installation procedure, isn't working for all, because when they installed the E-MAILiT button they had done it using the manual installation process. As a result, when they decided to un-install, they thought that by removing the plugin, it will also remove the javascript code which they had manually inserted in their websites. The result of this awkward situation is that those specific users are contacting with our support team, claiming that our plugin is a harmful malware, which leaves code behind, because they can not un-install it from their website. The only code that the plugin is going to position in a website, can be found here /wp-content/plugins/emailit directory, and there is no way for our plugin to work properly, if this folder has been deleted. We would like to inform, that our plugin is officially being accepted, after a thorough testing, from the WordPress Plugins Directory. Also, we don't write the un-uninstallation code of the plugin. This is an automated proccess through WordPress. After some threads to our support forum and a single private message via email, we wanted to put an end on this and finally to make it clear to any user, who tries to un-install with the wrong way our plugin.

<h4>How do I link the Facebook Like Button or the Tweet Button to my pages?</h4>

Facebook Like Button displays the likes about a specific url. In order to show correctly your likes you must place the button in the right place. If you haven't inserted the button in your home page, propably your likes are linked to it. If in case this is valid, by placing the button in your home page you will see the correct like counter for your site.

<h4>How do I set the integrated Follow Channels inside to my share button menu?</h4>

Create a free account and go to http://www.e-mailit.com/widget/control/add_domain

<h4>What languages do you support?</h4>

Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan; Valencian, Central Khmer, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch; Flemish, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Finnish, French, Galician,  Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, Haitian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Kurdish, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Malay, Maltese, Mongolian, Northern Sami, Norwegian, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai, Tswana, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, Welsh, Yiddish.

<h4>Why do I get your ads? How can I terminate them? Are you a spammer?</h4>

We are not spammers. By default, when a visitor returns to your site, after clicking to share your content via a service, they will see an advertisement, on the left of the share menu. This advertisement never shows when the share menu of the E-MAILiT button opens at first. It will never show up on your visitor's screen, if they do not click on a sharing service. Our strategy is not making you or your visitors feel frustrated, so we display advertisements in this smart way. On the other hand, you have the option to automatically show/hide the Ad Display on the widget's share menu. The advertisement is there for anyone interested to see, or you can simply hide it! It is that easy. The only thing you need to do is to create a free account and customize your settings.
